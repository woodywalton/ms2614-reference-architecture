// M-26-14 enablement framework.
//
// Single source of truth for the Sales and SA enablement pages. The structure
// mirrors the Self-Guided Walkthrough (public/docs/demo-guide.md): the questions
// an auditor actually asks, plus a capstone. Each pillar carries:
//   sales — the Elastic unique value proposition for that question
//   sa    — a depth ladder the SA can climb only as far as the room wants:
//           slide (stay high-level, animated) -> demo (scripted Instruqt) ->
//           live (drive the real cluster) -> docs (Elastic documentation)
//
// Live cluster and doc URLs are verified against the deployed pack and the
// published Elastic docs. Values that are data-driven (counts) are described
// qualitatively so a reseed does not make this page wrong.

    'This enablement is designed around what an agency must demonstrate to satisfy M-26-14 and the maturity levels defined in CISA\'s Logging Reference Architecture. The sales enablement provides a synopsis of what changed from M-21-31 to M-26-14, how Elastic specifically readies agencies to adopt M-26-14, and framing questions that map to each main section auditors will ask. The SA enablement lets you climb from a one-slide talk track down into a scripted demo, the live cluster, and the product documentation, stopping at whatever depth the room wants.',
